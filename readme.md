# Node testing using different libraries

## Npm packages used

1.  Mocha
    > [mocha](https://mochajs.org/ 'Mocha js site') is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
2.  Expect
    > You can think of [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect 'Expect github') as a more compact alternative to Chai or Sinon.JS, just without the pretty website.
3.  Supertest - HTTP assertions made easy via superagent.
    > The motivation with [this](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
4.  Rewire - Easy monkey-patching for node.js unit tests
    > [Rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire) adds a special setter and getter to modules so you can modify their behaviour for better unit testing.
